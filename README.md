# Abstract
Pine is a compiler and a compiled programming language that's intended for 64-bit machines. Pine depends on `gcc` or `clang`. Pine is a statically-typed programming language with syntax similar to Swift. A more comprehensive Pine tutorial will be written in the future. 

# Set Up
Run the `Makefile` located in `src` to build Pine, and then run Pine by giving it a `.pn` file. This will build an executable file named `a.out`.  
```
cd src/
make
./Pine Main.pn
./a.out
```
